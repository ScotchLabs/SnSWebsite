Static website for Scotch'n'Soda Theatre

## Current Branches

### master
The current static site at snstheatre.org

### style-edits
- Darkened the font
- Reverted col-8 column width back to original and use col-12 class for full-width images
- Planning on editing structure of Get Involved / Subtroupes pages

### roles-documentation
Working on a new page that will include all the show roles documentation (director, PM, SM, MD).

## Other Notes
- When editing: sometimes a page will look the same even after editing. If this happens, clear the browser cache and reload the site and the updates will show up.
